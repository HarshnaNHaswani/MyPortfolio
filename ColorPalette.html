                    <strong>Bright colors: </strong>Usage of bright colors should be sparse. Staring at bright colors 
                    for a long time hurts the eyes and makes them tired quickly. Though, they have their own benefits. 
                    When we look at something, the first thing we perceive is sharp colors. Hence, bright colors are good 
                    highlighters.<strong> Yellow, Orange, Red, and Neon</strong> are best examples of this. Best ways to use 
                    these colors are in highlights, accents, or muted shades of these colors.

                    <strong>Low blue light colors: Ever wondered why "Dark mode" is more comfortable to use? </strong>Colors containing higher level of blue light also cause eye-strain.
                    The background should never be stark white because it contains one of the highest intensities of blue light. 
                    Instead, use a tinted or neutral shade. The key to this is to use less green and least blue tones.

                <p>
                    That leaves us with no color to use <span>ðŸ˜‚</span>. Well, the key is to use a right level of contrast 
                    between the text and the background. Just remember to choose pleasing colors!!
