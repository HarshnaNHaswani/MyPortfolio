            <h2>Data Structure</h2>
            Knowledge on the the storing, retriving, and structuring of data is vital to software developers. 
            This helps them to create cost effective applications that are easy to use and fast. Knowing about the data structure
            is just a small part. Practical usage is key factor. Don't just gather information. Try understanding them, the reason why 
            things are the way they are. This also helps in retaining the knowledge for longer periods of time. 

            <h3 id= "stackBg">@Stack</h3>
            <p>The best example of a stack is the "Tower of Hanoi"
                Remember this? In this,  a ring be removed only if the ones above it are removed. Also, new rings can only be added on top
                of the existing ones. No ring can be added to the middle or removed in random.
                <img src="images\towerOf.png" alt="Tower of Hanoi image">
            </p>
            <p>Stacks are exactly like this. In technical terms, it is called </strong>LIFO</strong> which means <em>Last-In-First-Out</em>
            The element placed last will be removed first. If you insert or add  to the stack, you "push" it into the stack. If you remove an 
            element from the stack, you "pop" it out. The same point is used for entry and exit.
            </p>
            <p>Most common application of stack is during recursion and function calls</p>
            <h3 id= "queueBg">@Queue</h3>
            <p>Unlike stacks, queue has 2 contol points. One for entry and one for exit.  Take a road for an example. On one side of the road you can 
                only move in one direction. If you don't want to go in this direction, you have to wait for a turning point. Key point, you are stuck
                in traffic and the road is blocked, so you can't cut in front. You have to wait for the person befor you to move. This is called "Linear Queue". 
                At the turning point, if you take a u-turn and go back to where you came from, you are going in a circle. This type of queue is called "Circular Queue". 
                <img src="images\queue.jpg" alt="queue"><br><img src="images\q2.jpeg" alt="road">
                If you are in a hurry to reach somewhere. Reaching that place is your priority so you go faster. "Priority Queues" in 
                data structures has the same role. If something is important, put a priority on it and that task will be finished earlier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Technically, this is called <strong>FIFO</strong> - <em>First In First Out/ First Come First Serve.</em> You book your movie ticket first, 
                you get the seats first. When you insert an element to the queue it is called "enqueue" and when a element is removed it is called "dequeue"<div class=""></div>
            </p>
            <p>
                Queues are used when something does not have to done immediately except for priority items. Some of the examples include mailing services, buffers, and scheduling.

            <small>September, 2020</small>
            <p>Choosing the right colors is very important.
                More than text colors and images - visual 
                interpretations of the things set the tone and mood.
                Colors chosen right can make the simplest of web apps look cool and attractive. 
                Hence, it plays a key role in making a user friendly web-sites</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Bright colors: </strong>Usage of bright colors should be sparse. Staring at bright colors 
                for a long time hurts the eyes and makes them tired quickly. Though, they have their own benefits. 
                When we look at something, the first thing we perceive is sharp colors. Hence, bright colors are good 
                highlighters.<strong> Yellow, Orange, Red, and Neon</strong> are best examples of this. Best ways to use 
                these colors are in highlights, accents, or muted shades of these colors. 
                <div id="brightEg1" class=".colorPalette">xxx</div>

            <p>
                <strong>Low blue light colors: Ever wondered why "Dark mode" is more comfortable to use? </strong>Colors containing higher level of blue light also cause eye-strain.
                The background should never be stark white because it contains one of the highest intensities of blue light. 
                Instead, use a tinted or neutral shade. The key to this is to use less green and least blue tones. 
            </p>
            <p>
                That leaves us with no color to use <span>ðŸ˜‚</span>. Well, the key is to use a right level of contrast 
                between the text and the background. Just remember to choose pleasing colors!!
